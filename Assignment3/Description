There will be two types of users:
Admin
Customer
When the main script runs, the user will see two options:
Login
Register
Only ‘Customers’ can ‘Register’ using their ‘name’, ‘email’, and ‘password’.

There should be a separate PHP script to create ‘Admin’ users because regular users shouldn’t be allowed to register as ‘Admin’.

Based on the given ‘email’ and ‘password’ in the Login option:
The user will see the next menu options if the email and password matched
or see a message that the login has failed.
Menu options for the Admin:
See all the transactions by all the users
See transactions by a specific user (searching by their email)
See the list of all the customers
Menu options for the customer:
See all of their transactions
Deposit money to their account
Withdraw money from their account
Transfer money to another customer account (given their email address)
See the current balance of the account
